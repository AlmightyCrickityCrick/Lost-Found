as a group work within the PBL project.

The Client Application is implemented in Kotlin for Android and Server Application is implemented in Django, using MongoDB as the database. 

The Application will provide a Dashboard component for posting and browsing Lost/Found announcements, 
a chatting feature to connect people who have found or lost a particular object, as well as an interactive map to monitor 
objects lost nearby with push notification to notify users in real time about an object lost recently in their vicinity.
